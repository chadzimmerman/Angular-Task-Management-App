# Angular Task Manager

A simple task manager built with Angular to practice Angular after learning React. This application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks for different clients while maintaining the state across tasks. It's designed to help familiarize myself with Angular's core concepts, such as component-based architecture, services, and data binding.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks for various clients with detailed descriptions.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit existing tasks to update their details.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **State Management**: Maintain the state of tasks across different client components, ensuring updates are reflected correctly in the UI.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: The core framework for building the app.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and defining interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive design and styling.

## Installation

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/angular-task-manager.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd angular-task-manager
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
